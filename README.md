# HW-1-code_refractor

## Description

Webpage:
This is a webpage for a SEO marketing firm with basic description of the type of marketing they do, with navigation links to whichever marketing strategy the user would be interested in. There is a brief description of how that marketing strategy works, along with tips and suggestions about how important marketing is for any product/business.

CSS:
In the css file there are comments to display how the code works and why it was implemented

Our Task:
Through this code refractor project we were given the task to clean up an already made webpage to make sure it is more accessible. This included restructuring the divs to follow a more linear logic and to make sure that the code could be read in a more "top down" way. While working on this we had to make sure not to tamper with the finished visual aspect of the product, the website.
